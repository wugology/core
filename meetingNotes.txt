Meeting Notes:
1/27/15
* Wugbot color: #39f39f
* 2 kinds of style guides:
  - DLX styles - pattern library (HTML plus CSS, no JS)
    - Does not include the JS schema (that's in the Learn section), it's just the markup
    - Eventually include print/online versions for publishing journal articles
  - also a Wugbot style guide, that's very simple
* when you want to get for realzies about a tool, you take it out of the sandbox and create a new repo for it
* interactive landing activity - a demo, or a tutorial
  - probably just a static demo with three sections:
    1. data input
    2. JSON visualizer
    3. output vizualizer, with 3 diff. outputs (lexicon, interlinear gloss, revitalization page output)
  - maybe a Learn More link that does the actual walkthrough
* possible tutorials:
  - digital linguistics and well-structured data
  - how to use the app
