Meeting Notes:
1/27/15
* Wugbot color: #39f39f
* 2 kinds of style guides:
  - DLX styles - pattern library (HTML plus CSS, no JS)
    - Does not include the JS schema (that's in the Learn section), it's just the markup
    - Eventually include print/online versions for publishing journal articles
  - also a Wugbot style guide, that's very simple
* when you want to get for realzies about a tool, you take it out of the sandbox and create a new repo for it
