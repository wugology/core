<h1>HTML Linguistics Core</h1>

<p>This project will contain infrastructure for the core data model for HTLX. As such,
it is expected that every interface which deals with an HTLX-style representation of
data will include this core.</p>

<p>This data representation is implemented (here) with Backbone.js <code>Collections</code>
(corresponding to <code>Arrays</code> above) and <code>Models</code> (corresponding to objects).</p>

<ul>
<li>[] represents an array</li>
<li>{} an object</li>
<li>-“” a Unicode string</li>
</ul>

<p>HTLX is conceived of as a series of interfaces and data management practices which enable:</p>

<ol>
<li>Conversion and restructuring of existing linguistic information of any sort to the above structure.</li>
<li>Efficient input to HTLX by the linguist in a fieldwork setting.</li>
</ol>

<p>The goal of HTLX is not to dictate every detail of the linguist’s workflow; rather, it is to take advantage 
of a series of loosely-connected interfaces which encourage automation where it is useful: the evasion of
drudgery of all kinds, be it <em>harmful</em> or <em>harmless</em>. </p>
